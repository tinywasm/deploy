Automated Continuous Deployment (CD) framework for Windows/Linux. Designed around a **Push/Pull model**: includes a **Puller** agent that orchestrates updates on the server, and multiple **Pusher** implementations (Cloudflare, SSH, Webhooks) to trigger or execute deployments. Features automatic health checks and rollbacks.

## Quick Summary

- **Push/Pull Model**: Decoupled architecture where a local **Puller** agent handles the lifecycle, triggered by external **Pushers**.
- **Security**: HMAC-SHA256 request validation + cross-platform keyring for multi-service secret storage.
- **Resilient**: Automatic health-check verification and atomic rollback if the new version fails.
- **Zero-dependency binary**: Single `.exe`, no runtime required

## Dependencies

- [`tinywasm/keyring`](../keyring) — Cross-platform secret storage (DPAPI on Windows, Keychain on macOS, Secret Service on Linux)
